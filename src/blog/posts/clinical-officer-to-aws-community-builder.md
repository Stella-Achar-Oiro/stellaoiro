Five years ago, I was working night shifts at a county hospital in Migori, Kenya. Today, I'm an AWS Community Builder helping healthcare organizations build secure cloud infrastructure.

This is the story of how I made that transition—and what I learned along the way.

## The Breaking Point

**2018, 2 AM, County Hospital Emergency Room**

A patient arrives with a complex medical history. We need their previous records urgently. The EMR system crashes. Again.

We make critical decisions with incomplete information.

That night, I realized something: **Technology wasn't helping us—it was failing us.**

Our medical systems couldn't talk to each other. Patient data was scattered across incompatible platforms. Healthcare teams were drowning in compliance requirements they didn't understand.

Someone needed to fix this. Someone who understood both the clinical side and the technical side.

## The First Steps: Learning to Code

I didn't have a Computer Science degree. I didn't know anyone in tech. I just knew I needed to learn.

**What I did:**
1. Started with **Python** on freeCodeCamp (30 minutes before work, every day)
2. Built a simple patient tracking system (it was terrible, but it worked)
3. Learned about databases (PostgreSQL) because patient data needs somewhere to go
4. Discovered cloud computing (AWS specifically) and realized this was the future

**Key insight:** You don't need permission to start learning. You just need consistency.

## From Code to Cloud: Discovering AWS

My first AWS project was a disaster.

I spun up an EC2 instance, forgot to shut it down, and got a $200 bill. I was devastated.

But that mistake taught me something crucial: **Cloud infrastructure has real costs and real consequences.** In healthcare, those consequences can affect patient care.

So I got serious:
- Completed AWS Cloud Practitioner certification
- Built a HIPAA-compliant file storage system on S3
- Learned Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Started writing about what I was learning

## The Healthcare Advantage

Here's what most developers don't realize: **Healthcare experience is a massive competitive advantage in cloud engineering.**

When I architect a healthcare system, I understand:
- Why a 3-second delay isn't just bad UX—it's a clinical risk
- Why audit logging isn't bureaucracy—it's patient safety
- Why encryption at rest and in transit aren't optional—they're ethical requirements
- Why system uptime is literally a matter of life and death

This perspective makes me a better cloud engineer.

## Becoming an AWS Community Builder

In 2021, I applied to the AWS Community Builders program.

I almost didn't apply. I thought: "I don't have a CS degree. I'm not a 'real' developer. They won't want someone like me."

**I was wrong.**

AWS Community Builders celebrates diverse backgrounds and perspectives. They wanted someone who could bridge healthcare and technology. Someone who could teach cloud engineering through real-world medical scenarios.

**What being a Community Builder means:**
- Access to AWS experts and resources
- Platform to share knowledge with the global community
- Validation that non-traditional paths into tech are valuable
- Responsibility to give back and help others learn

## Building Real Solutions

Theory is great. Production systems are better.

At **Evarest Technologies**, we've built:

### Kintaraa (GBV Prevention Platform)
- Blockchain platform supporting 847 survivors across Kisumu County
- 1,203 incident reports processed securely
- AWS infrastructure for sensitive data handling
- Real-time alert systems for emergency response

### Healthcare Data Systems
- HIPAA-compliant medical record processing systems
- Secure telemedicine platforms with end-to-end encryption
- Real-time patient monitoring dashboards
- EHR integration systems for healthcare startups

These aren't tutorial projects. They're production systems affecting real lives.

## What I Learned Along the Way

### 1. Your "Non-Tech" Background is an Asset

Don't hide your previous career. Healthcare, finance, education—these backgrounds give you context that pure CS grads don't have.

Use it.

### 2. Start Building Before You're Ready

My first AWS project was terrible. My second was slightly less terrible. My tenth was actually good.

You learn by doing, not by reading.

### 3. Document Everything

I write about what I'm learning for two reasons:
- Teaching solidifies knowledge
- Future me (and others) benefit from the documentation

This blog exists because I needed these tutorials when I was learning.

### 4. Community Matters

AWS Community Builders, DEV Community, Twitter tech—these communities accelerated my learning 10x.

Find your people. Share your journey. Help others.

### 5. Imposter Syndrome Never Fully Goes Away

I still feel it. Every AWS Community Builder probably does.

The difference? I've learned to recognize it as a sign that I'm pushing myself to grow.

## The Reality: It Wasn't Easy

Let me be honest about what this transition cost:

- **Time**: 5+ years of consistent learning (evenings, weekends, early mornings)
- **Money**: Certification exams, online courses, AWS bills from mistakes
- **Relationships**: Less time with friends and family while studying
- **Comfort**: Leaving a stable clinical career to start a tech company
- **Confidence**: Countless moments of "I'm not good enough for this"

**Was it worth it?** Absolutely.

But anyone who tells you career transitions are easy is lying.

## Advice for Healthcare Professionals Eyeing Tech

### If You're a Doctor, Nurse, Clinical Officer, Pharmacist...

Your skills translate more than you think:

**Clinical Skill** → **Tech Equivalent**
- Diagnosis → Debugging
- Treatment Plans → System Architecture
- Patient Communication → Stakeholder Management
- Evidence-Based Medicine → Data-Driven Decisions
- Triage → Priority Management

### Start Here:

1. **Pick one programming language** (Python is great for healthcare + data)
2. **Build something healthcare-related** (even if it's simple)
3. **Learn cloud basics** (AWS Cloud Practitioner certification)
4. **Document your learning** (blog, YouTube, Twitter)
5. **Connect with healthcare tech community** (AWS Community, DEV)

### Free Resources I Used:

- freeCodeCamp (Python, JavaScript)
- AWS Free Tier (hands-on practice)
- YouTube (AWS tutorials, system design)
- DEV Community (networking, learning)
- AWS Community Builders (mentorship, resources)

## Where I'm Going Next

The journey isn't over:

- **Currently**: Pursuing Masters in Clinical Medicine & Surgery at Great Lakes University
- **Learning**: Kubernetes (KCNA certification prep)
- **Teaching**: Lecturer at Kenya Medical Training College
- **Building**: More healthcare cloud solutions at Evarest Technologies
- **Writing**: This blog, guest posts, AWS Community content

## Final Thoughts

**You don't need:**
- CS degree
- Perfect English
- Silicon Valley connections
- Permission to start

**You do need:**
- Curiosity about technology
- Willingness to learn consistently
- Patience with yourself
- Real problems to solve
- Community support

Healthcare needs more technologists who understand medicine. Medicine needs more clinicians who understand technology.

If you're somewhere in between, you're exactly where the world needs you.
