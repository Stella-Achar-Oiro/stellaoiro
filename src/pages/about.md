## The Story

My journey didn't follow the traditional tech career path—and that's exactly what makes it valuable.

I started as a **Clinical Officer** with the County Government of Migori, working directly with patients and seeing firsthand how technology could transform healthcare delivery. But I also saw the gaps: medical systems that couldn't talk to each other, patient data scattered across platforms, and healthcare teams struggling with compliance requirements they barely understood.

So I learned to code. Then I learned cloud engineering. Then I dove deep into AWS.

**Not to leave healthcare, but to fix it from the inside.**

### What Makes Me Different

I speak two languages fluently: **clinical medicine and cloud architecture**.

When a healthcare startup asks me to design their infrastructure, I don't just think about uptime and latency. I think about patient safety. I understand why a 3-second delay in loading a medical record isn't just a UX issue—it's a clinical risk.

When I write about HIPAA compliance, I'm not regurgitating AWS documentation. I've actually handled Protected Health Information (PHI). I know what it means when something goes wrong.

And when I teach AWS to developers, I use real-world healthcare scenarios because I've lived them.

## What I Do Now

### 🏗️ Build Healthcare Cloud Systems

At **Evarest Technologies Ltd**, I architect cloud infrastructure for medical applications. Recent projects include:

- **Gojiberri**: AI-powered medical transcription system processing sensitive patient data
- **Kintaraa**: Blockchain platform for gender-based violence prevention (847 survivors, 1,203 incident reports across Kisumu County)
- HIPAA-compliant EHR integrations for healthcare startups

### ☁️ AWS Community Building

As an **AWS Community Builder**, I:
- Create tutorials and content for developers learning cloud engineering
- Contribute to the AWS community through technical writing and open-source projects
- Speak about healthcare cloud architecture and compliance
- Help others navigate the path from traditional careers into tech

### 📚 Teaching & Mentoring

I lecture at **Kenya Medical Training College**, teaching the next generation of healthcare professionals how technology fits into patient care. I also mentor developers transitioning into cloud engineering, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds.

### 🎓 Continuous Learning

Currently studying for Kubernetes certifications (KCNA) while completing my **Masters in Clinical Medicine & Surgery** at Great Lakes University of Kisumu. Because the intersection of healthcare and technology is where I thrive.

## Technical Expertise

### Programming & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Bash
- **Frameworks**: Node.js, FastAPI
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, MongoDB
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, DataDog

## Why Work With Me?

### 1. Unique Perspective
I understand clinical workflows because I've lived them. When I design your healthcare system, I'm thinking about 2 AM emergency scenarios, not just happy-path user journeys.

### 2. Real-World Experience
I don't just write tutorials—I build production systems. My architectures handle real patient data, real compliance audits, real stakes.

### 3. Communication Bridge
I can explain technical concepts to clinical staff and clinical requirements to developers. That's rare and valuable.

### 4. Compliance Expertise
HIPAA isn't just a checklist to me. I understand *why* each requirement exists and *how* to implement it without killing your product velocity.

### 5. Cost-Conscious
Building in East Africa taught me to optimize for 3G networks and tight budgets. Your infrastructure will be lean, fast, and affordable.

## Beyond Work

I'm a father to Daniella Hera, who keeps me grounded and reminds me why building better healthcare systems matters. When I'm not coding or studying, I'm probably exploring how emerging technologies like AI and blockchain can solve healthcare challenges in African contexts.
