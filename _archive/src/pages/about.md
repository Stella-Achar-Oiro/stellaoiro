## The Story

My path to technical writing wasn't traditional—and that's exactly what makes it valuable.

I started as a **Clinical Officer** in Kenya, working directly with patients and medical systems. But I kept seeing the same problem: brilliant technology that nobody could figure out how to use.

Medical devices with manuals that required a PhD to understand. Software systems with documentation that assumed you already knew everything. Critical healthcare tools that sat unused because the learning curve was too steep.

So I learned to bridge that gap. First by learning to code. Then by learning cloud architecture. Finally by mastering the art of making complex things simple.

**I don't just write about technology—I build it. Then I explain it in a way that actually helps people.**

### What Makes Me Different

I speak two languages fluently: **technical complexity and human clarity**.

When I document your API, I don't just describe the endpoints—I understand the developer's frustration when authentication doesn't work. I've debugged those same issues at 2 AM.

When I write about HIPAA compliance, I'm not copying regulations. I've actually implemented compliant systems and passed audits. I know what auditors actually look for.

When I create user guides, I think like both the developer who built the feature and the user who's seeing it for the first time.

## What I Do Now

### Technical Writing & Documentation

I create technical documentation that developers actually want to read:

- **API Documentation**: Interactive docs with working code examples
- **Developer Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials that actually work
- **SaaS Onboarding**: User flows that reduce churn and support tickets
- **Compliance Documentation**: HIPAA, SOC2, and regulatory guides

### Development & Architecture

At **Evarest Technologies Ltd**, I build the systems I document:

- **Kintaraa**: Blockchain platform handling sensitive data for 847+ users
- HIPAA-compliant APIs and healthcare integrations
- AWS cloud architectures for healthcare startups
- Full-stack applications with React and Node.js

### AWS Community Building

As an **AWS Community Builder**, I:
- Write technical content about cloud architecture and healthcare compliance
- Speak at conferences about documentation best practices
- Mentor developers transitioning into technical writing
- Contribute to open-source documentation projects

### Teaching & Training

I help teams improve their documentation:
- Workshop facilitation for engineering teams
- Documentation strategy consulting
- Technical writing training for developers
- Compliance documentation for healthcare organizations

## Technical Expertise

### Technical Writing Tools
- **Documentation Platforms**: GitBook, Notion, Confluence, Sphinx, MkDocs
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman, Insomnia
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Miro, Lucidchart
- **Content Management**: WordPress, Ghost, Contentful

### Development Skills
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Bash
- **Frameworks**: React, Node.js, FastAPI
- **Cloud**: AWS (Community Builder), Docker, Kubernetes
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, MongoDB

### Healthcare & Compliance
- **Standards**: HIPAA, HL7/FHIR, SOC2
- **Healthcare Tech**: EHR integration, medical device APIs
- **Security**: Encryption, audit logging, access controls
- **Clinical Background**: Patient workflows, medical terminology

## Why Work With Me?

### 1. Developer + Writer Combination
I don't just write about technology—I build it. This means I understand both the technical complexity and the human need for clarity.

### 2. Proven Results
My documentation has reduced support tickets by 60%, accelerated developer onboarding by 75%, and helped companies pass compliance audits.

### 3. Healthcare Domain Expertise
Real-world experience with HIPAA compliance, medical workflows, and healthcare technology challenges that most technical writers lack.

### 4. User-Centered Approach
I start with user research, not technical specifications. My documentation solves real problems that real people face.

### 5. Full-Stack Understanding
From frontend UX to backend APIs to cloud infrastructure—I understand the complete technical picture and can document it clearly.

## Beyond Work

I'm a father to Daniella Hera, who keeps me grounded and reminds me why building better healthcare systems matters. When I'm not coding or studying, I'm probably exploring how emerging technologies like AI and blockchain can solve healthcare challenges in African contexts.

## Credentials & Achievements

- Technical Writer + Developer (5+ years)
- AWS Community Builder
- Clinical Officer with healthcare compliance expertise
- Co-founder, Evarest Technologies Ltd
- Technical Lead, Kintaraa platform (847+ users)
